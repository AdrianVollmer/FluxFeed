# Feed Filter and Groups

The feed filter does not scale. Imagine a user has dozens of feeds, then the
area under "Filter by Feed:" will become quite large.

Also, we will want to organize feeds in a hierarchy. For this, we need to
introduce groups, which can contain feeds and/or other groups.
Then we can replace the "Filter by Feed:" area with a button that shows a modal
with the group/feed hierarchy, where the user can select and unselect groups or
feeds.
