# Adaptive Fetch Frequency

I specified a minimum fetch frequency of 1h, but I can see some feeds
are fetched every 30 minutes, even though new articles appear roughly
weekly.

Also, when editing a feed with adaptive fetching, the "Custom" radio
button is selected with an empty value, which makes no sense.

If no custom frequency has been set, then adaptive fetching is active,
and the "effective frequency" should be adjusted over time based on
historical article frequency.
