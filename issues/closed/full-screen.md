Add a third view mode besides the Cards view and Compact list view: Full
screen.

In full screen, we have three sections: The menu, the feed list, and the
content. The menu and feed should take up half of the entire screen
width (or browser window width), the content the rest.

The menu should show the group tree instead of having to click on a
button to show it.

When clicking on an article, the content should appear in the content
section. Since this content will be the same as the on from reader mode,
the icon for the reader mode should not be visible in full screen mode.
