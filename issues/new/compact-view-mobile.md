# Compact View on Mobile

On mobile, the compact view is way too crowded. It has text running into
other text.

We need to display the feed name first in its own line, then the title
in a new line, then the buttons and the author. I guess it needs to look
more like the cards, except without the spacing and the images.

I know this goes against tables, so try to find an elegant solution. If in doubt, let's not use the `table` element in the HTML.

Check with playwright to make sure.
