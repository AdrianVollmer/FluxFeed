# Content style

The content in the article cards contains HTML tags like `h3`, `li`, etc, but
they appear entirely unstyled. Only `code` tags get a monospace font, but that
is it. (They should get some sort of gray highlighting or something.)

Try to find a general solution instead of adding a CSS rule for each element.
