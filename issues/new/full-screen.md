Add a third view mode besides the Cards view and Compact list view: Full
screen.

In full screen, we have three sections: The menu, the feed list, and the
content. The menu and feed should take up half the screen width, the
content the rest.

The menu should show the group tree instead of having to click on a
button to show it.
