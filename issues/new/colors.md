# Article Colors

First change the "Edit Frequency" button to "Edit Feed". It should take the user
to a page where they can edit all properties, including the color.

In the list view of articles, the accent color should be included in the card or
the table row (in case of compact view) somehow. It should be clearly visible,
but not too intrusive.
